    <h2>Recipes</h2>
    <p>The cookbook above was a wedding gift to my mother in 1964.  When my mother became ill in 2017 and passed 3 weeks later my father asked me what I wanted of my mothers and before he could finish the question I said I want her cookbook.  I only remember my mom looking up a recipe occasionally in the cookbook, but that cookbook had been around at the start of her little family and the memory of it always being on the kitchen counter was home.</p>
      
    <p>The first month after her passing I read that cookbook from cover to cover and along the way I found comfort in all the hand-written notes in the margins of the cookbook and the recipes she had written down on the back of envelopes stuffed between the pages.</p>
    
    <p>I, myself, get much joy from cooking.  I love to try new recipes, discover tricks of the trade, and put my own twist on something old.  These 5 recipes will make you a star whether it is having to put a last minute appetizer together becaue that is all the notice your husband gives you about having to take something to the work potluck, all the way to an easy, fun sweet treat and a few recipes in the middle.</p>
