      <h4>What's Cooking</h4>
      <p>Cooking is what relaxes me.  I have solved many a problem in the kitchen adding a pinch of this and a dash of that.  Chopping vegetables, deciding what protein to serve with the meal, and stirring things in a pot leaves my core at peace.</p>
      <p>When I haven't been to the grocery store because I haven't had time, but I still need to get dinner on the table I get a rush!  I love the challenge of seeing what I have in the kitchen and get inspired to turn the bare essentials into something filling and delicious.</p>
