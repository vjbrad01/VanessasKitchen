      <h4>My Cooking Journey</h4>
        <p>I have been a collector of cookbooks for many years; I read them like they were novels. Turning the pages to discover new and exciting dishes.</p>
        <p>When my mother passed away unexpectedly my father asked me what of my mother's did I want and before he could finish the question I answered, 'her cookbook'.</p>
        <p>Before there was ever a Food Network channel I was watching cooking shows on PBS; Frugal Gourmet, Martha Stewart, Julia Childs to name a few.</p>
