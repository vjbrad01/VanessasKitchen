          <h3>Cooking Recipes</h3><br>
          <h4>Recipes Are Made for Experimenting</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Experiment!  Don't be afraid to make the recipe your own.  Don't like an ingredient in the recipe, leave it out or maybe replace it with an ingredient you do like.
              </li>
              <li>If you treat recipes as building blocks you will find a great joy in getting food to the table.</li>
            </ol>
          <h4>Cook Once/Eat Twice</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>When browning any type of ground meat double the amount needed. Use what you need and freeze other portion for a differnt meal.</p>
              </li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <p>Cooked meat for 1st night.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Sloppy Joes, ChilLi for Chilli Cheese Fries, or my favorite TACO NIGHT</p>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
              <li>
                <p>Grilling meat works the same way. Cook double and freeze extra for later use in a variety of dishes.</p>
              </li>  
              <li>
                <p>Cooked rice is another easy thing to make double portion and freeze. Easy to pull from freezer to thaw and add to soups, casseroles, etc.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Spaghetti noodles are another great freezer staple.  Some nights I have more noodles than needed so I add a touch of olive oil/butter to extra noodles and freeze.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>When freezing anything label and date container.</strong></p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          <h4>Lettuce</h4>
            <p><em>Say goodbye to brown/wilted lettuce forever</em></p>
            <ol>
              <li>Making a salad; keep lettuce separate from the toppings adding to your salad.  Some toppings can add moisture to the lettuce.
              </li>
              <li>Left over lettuce will keep longer by adding a dry paper towel to container you are storing lettuce.</li>
            </ol>
          <h4>Bottom of the Jar</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Jelly/Fruit Spreads make great dressings for salads or add to BBQ sauce</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Salad dressing:  add acid (squeeze lemon or pour any type of vinegar), whisk while drizzling in olive oil, add salt and pepper to taste.
                    </li>
                    <li>BBQ Sauce:  I just pour store bought BBQ sauce into jelly/fruit jar and shake well; adds a great flavor to your BBQ!</li>
                  </ul>
                
                <li>Peanut Butter makes a great sauce for a twist on noodles</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Peanut Butter sauce:  In jar add some soy or teriyaki sauce along with your favorite hot sauce if you like it spicy, add lid to jar, and shake to mix.If too thick you can add some water until mixture is at your desired consistency.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
            </ol>
            <h4>My Newest Loves</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Fresh Ground Horseradish in a jar - I use to make my own cocktail sauce and it is delicious to make deviled eggs pop!
                </li>
                <li>Chili Garlic Sauce - I put this in anything I want to add a kick of spice - A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY!
                </li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Spaghetti Sauce, Pho, BBQ Sauce, Chilli; the options are endless
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                <li>Seasoned Rice Vinegar-I mix this with Dijon mustard and olive oil for a quick salad dressing.
                </li>
                <li>Red Wine Vinegar-I mix this in my coleslaw to give it tang.
                </li>
                <li>Dijon Mustard-I mix into any cream-based salad (egg salad, potato salad, pasta salad, etc.).
                </li>
                <li>Sesame Oil-I use it for any Asion dishes I cook.  It can be pricey, but a little goes a long way.
                </li>
            </ol>
